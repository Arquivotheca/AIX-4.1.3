# DClass   - name uniquely identifying a device class
# DSClass  - name uniquely identifying a device subclass
# DType    - name uniquely identifying a device type
# Ports    - number of ports on the card if a multi-port card
# Pset     - set id of message set in catalog file dcda.msg (vendor.msg)
#	     (see Menu bit 16 below if not using dcda.msg file)
# PreTest  - set if device is to be tested before system comes up.
#          - value equals 1 if not a display device
#          - value equals 2 if a display device
# AttDType - names a device that has a device driver that supports DType.

# DaName   - name of Diagnostic Application associated with device
#            When DaName is prefixed with a "*", the diagnostic controller will
#            get the value of the attribute name that follows the "*", then
#            uses the attribute value obtained to get the real DaName from the
#            PDiagAtt object class. This method is used to allow support of
#            devices having the same DType, but requiring different DA.
# Diskette - 0 => Not on any diskette
#            X => Diskette number
#            S => Supplemental Diskette
