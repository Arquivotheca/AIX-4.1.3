        INTRODUCTION

        Hardware Overview -

        The card under test is a microchannel adapter, occupying one slot.
        The primary components of the adapter are a Standard Microsystems
        Corporation MCI94C18A microchannel interface chip, a Crystal Semi-
        conductor Corporation CS4231 Audio Codec and audio input and output
        amplifiers.  The adapter is a single FRU.


        FRU Test Coverage -

        The primary TU's described here are designed to isolate the adapter
        to a 95% confidence level without operator interaction.  Additional
        test units are useful for development and manufacting, for component
        level testing.

        EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT

        Device Driver Load/Unload

        The test units for the audio adapter do not use the device
        driver used by applications, but have a driver which is
        unique to diagnostics.  Thus, before the test units are run
        the audio adapter must be first returned from the "available"
        state to the "defined" state, and then placed into the diagnostics
        state using special configuration files.  The following files
        are unique to diagnostics are are required:

                /etc/drivers/bauddiagdd
                /etc/drivers/bauddiagpin
                /etc/methods/cfgdiagbaud
                /etc/methods/ucfgdiagbaud

        The following sequence is recommended for placing the device
        into the diagnostic state (device name /dev/baud1 is used here
        as an example):

                odm_run_method("ucfgdevice", "-l baud1", &msg, &err);
                odm_run_method("cfgdiagbaud", "-l baud1", &msg, &err);


        After diagnostics are complete, use this sequence to return the
        device to the "available" state:

                odm_run_method("ucfgdiagbaud", "-l baud1", &msg, &err);
                odm_run_method("cfgbaud", "-l baud1", &msg, &err);


        Refer to the "AIX Calls and Subroutine Reference: Base Operating
        System, Volume 1" for further information on these calls.
