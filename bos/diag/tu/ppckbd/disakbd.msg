$ GENERAL NOTES
$
$ Do not translate %d, %s, %x, %07X, or \t in any messages.  They
$   are used for word or number substitution and are noted in the
$   comments for the individual messages.  The 1$, 2$, 3$, etc,
$   within the substitutions are used to denote the order of the
$   substitutions.
$
$ These comments concern the TITLE LINES at the top the diagnostic screen.
$   The title must be in all capital letters. The first line
$   of the title cannot be longer than 70 characters starting from 
$   column 1.  If the line is greater than 70, it may be continued on
$   the next line.  Leave line spacing as shown:  one blank line after
$   the last title line.  For example:
$
$ *****
$ TESTING PORT 12 OF THE 16-PORT ASYNCHRONOUS ADAPTER IN PLANAR SLOT 2
$ IN ADVANCED MODE
$
$ Please stand by.
$ *****
$
$ These comments concern the user ACTIONS in all caps.
$   If translations require the creation of new lines, begin the
$   new lines in the column immediately following the row of periods. 
$   For example:
$
$ *****
$ ACTION.........one line of English might require several when translated, so
$                begin the next line at the same point of the previous line.
$ ACTION.........the next action follows with no blank line preceding it.
$ *****
$
$
$ LED is an acronym for Light Emitting Diode.  DO NOT TRANSLATE unless an
$    equivalent term exists in the translating language.
$
$ Toggle refers to a particular type of switch or key action where the same
$   action can produce different results depending on the original state.
$   For example, a key press that toggles the video between normal and
$   reverse would change from one state to the next.
