/* FUNCTION NAME: set_sem(wait_time)
   
   DESCRIPTION: This function access the POS register 2 via the IPC
   semaphore which should be used by all programs desiring
   the access. The user passes in a "wait_time" to specify
   whether or not to "wait_forever" for the semaphore or
   retry MAX_SEM_RETRIES with a wait_interval of "wait_time" 
   
   NOTES:       This function is used basically to overcome the concurrent 
   access of the POS register 2 by the Keyboard/Tablet,
   Diskette, Serial Port 1 and 2, Parallel Port and Mouse
   devices. This function is used only in NON INTERACTIVE
   TUs and in this case TU 01, 02, 03, 04, 05.
