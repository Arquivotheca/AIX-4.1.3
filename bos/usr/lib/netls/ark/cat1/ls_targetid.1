     _l_s__t_a_r_g_e_t_i_d is used to find the NetLS ID used by  NetLS  for
     locking licenses to a particular machine.

     To create NetLS licenses for an application, an  application
     supplier whose application uses NetLS licenses will need the
     NetLS ID of  the  machine  executing  the  netlsd,  or  when
     nodelocked  NetLS  licenses are desired, the NetLS ID of the
     machine where the application will be executing.   Different
     devices  are  used  to  derive the NetLS ID depending on the
     type of NetLS license that is desired and also the  type  of
     machine which will be storing the license.

     On an HP-UX machine licenses managed  by  the  netlsd  (con-
     current and use once licenses), the NetLS ID is derived from
     the link level address of the LAN card accessed by the  dev-
     ice file /dev/ls_targetid on the machine that is running the
     netlsd.  If /dev/ls_targetid  does not exist and the  super-
     user  is  executing  _l_s__t_a_r_g_e_t_i_d,  _l_s__t_a_r_g_e_t_i_d  will  create
     /dev/ls_targetid.  On a hp9000s300, /dev/ls_targetid will be
     created  for  the built in LAN card installed at select code
     21 or, if there is no LAN card installed at select code  21,
     the  LAN  card installed in the lowest numbered select code.
     On a hp9000s800, the device file will be for  the  lan0  LAN
     card.  This is the same method used by the netlsd for deter-
     mining the NetLS ID of the machine on which it is executing.

     On HP-UX, for NetLS nodelocked licenses,  the  NetLS  ID  is
     derived from:

          +o   The LAN card accessed by /dev/ls_targetid, or

          +o   The built in SPU ID number, or

          +o   An HIL ID Module.
