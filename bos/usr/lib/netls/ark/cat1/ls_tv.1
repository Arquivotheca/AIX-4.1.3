     The llllssss____ttttvvvv tool requests a concurrent-access license  from  a
     license server and prints a list of active license servers.

     If you can run llllssss____ttttvvvv successfully but  are  still  having  a
     problem  with  a  licensed  product, the problem is probably
     with the licenses, or possibly with the product  itself:  in
     this  case, talk to the vendor of the licensed software pro-
     duct.

     If you can't run llllssss____ttttvvvv successfully and receive one  of  the
     error  messages  listed  below,  use  the explanation of the
     error to fix the problem. Then try running llllssss____ttttvvvv again.

     If you can't run llllssss____ttttvvvv successfully  and  receive  an  error
     that's  not  listed  below, it means there is a problem with
     the software on which LSSERVER is layered (for example,  TCP
     or NCS), or a hardware problem.

          deleted the vendor Apollo from license servers.

     netls_license_not_found
          Someone has deleted the licenses for llllssss____ttttvvvv; this prohi-
          bits anyone from using the test and verification tool.

     netls_not_authorized
          Someone has edited the user file to restrict the use of
          llllssss____ttttvvvv.

     netls_bad_timestamp
          Node clocks have not been  synchronized  to  within  12
          hours.
