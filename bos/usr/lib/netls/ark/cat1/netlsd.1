     ----nnnnoooo  Turns  off  logging  of   the   events   specified   in
          event_list.  Any  combination  of  events is valid, but
          items in the list of events must not  be  separated  by
          spaces  or  other  characters.  Following are the event
          types that you may specify:

          llll    License-grant and license-release events.

          cccc    License checkin events. (Licensed products usually
               check in with the license server at regular inter-
               vals while a user is using the product).

          wwww    Waiting events: these include wait events (a  user
               was  waiting  for  a license), waitgrant events (a
               user was  waiting  for  and  then  was  granted  a
               license),  and waitremove events (a user was wait-
               ing for a license and then  asked  to  be  removed
               from the queues before a license was granted).

          vvvv    Vendor events: a  vendor  was  added,  renamed  or
               deleted.

          pppp    Product events: a product was added,  renamed,  or
               deleted.

          eeee    Error events.

          tttt    License timeout events. (When a  licensed  product
               fails  to check in with the license server, it may
               stop running after it times out."  The  vendor  of
               the  product  sets  the timeout interval, which is
               how long a product may run after it has lost  con-
               tact with the license server).

          mmmm    Message events.

          ssss    License server start/stop events.

netlsd(1M)            Maintenance Commands             netlsd(1M)



          Overrides the default name and  location  of  the  file
          used  to  store  log  information.  This allows the I/O
          activity to the files used by the license server to  be
          spread across multiple disks which may become important
          for large installations.

     ----oooo   Overrides the in-use flag at a license server database.
          While  a  license  server  is  running, its database is
          flagged as being in use to prevent more than one server
          from  running  on  the same node. When a license server
          stops running, the flag is reset. However, if a license
          server  exits  abnormally,  the  flag may not be reset,
          which prevents  the  server  from  restarting.  The  ----oooo
          option  overrides an inuse flag, allowing the server to
          be restarted. Do not use ----oooo unless  you  are  sure  the
          license server isn't running.

     ----ssss   Secure option.  Will only allow changes to the  license
          database to be initiated from tools run on that partic-
          ular workstation.  Ls_admin commands  (like  add  user,
          delete  product,  etc) run from other workstations will
          not be allowed.

     ----vvvv   NetLS library verbose mode.

     ----zzzz   Debugging flag. (Prints RPC debugging information).
