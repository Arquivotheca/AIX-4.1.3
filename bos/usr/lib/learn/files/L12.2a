To compare two files, you can use the command
"diff" (differences); the line
  diff xx yy
will compare the files xx and yy and tell you about
any differences between them.  If the files are the same,
the command says nothing.  Are the files
"tom" and "dick" the same in this directory?
Find out (print them if you feel insecure)
and reply "yes" or "no".
