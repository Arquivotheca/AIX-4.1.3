The computer keeps track of information in "files."
A file might contain a letter to a friend,
or a memo (or part of it) that you are typing,
or any number of other things.
You can list the names of your files
by typing the command "ls".
Try "ls" now; then type "ready".
Remember that each command must go on a separate line
and each line must be ended with RETURN.

#copyin
