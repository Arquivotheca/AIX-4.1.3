You can use patterns for file names with commands
other than "ls".  For example, you can use them with
the "cat" command to print files.
This directory has three files named
  parta
  partb
  partc
You can use
  cat part?
to print all of them.  Try that; then
type "ready".
#create parta
This is file parta;
it has two lines.
#create partb
File partb here - has only one line.
#create partc
And now in file partc, which has
the enormous total of
three lines.
#create partxxx
You shouldn't have printed this one.
#copyin
#user
#uncopyin
grep 'cat part?' .copy >/dev/null
#log
#next
