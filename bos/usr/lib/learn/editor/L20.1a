You can now change a line of a file, using only the commands
already taught, by deleting the old line and inserting a new one.
This is not a very convenient way to do that, so there is a
command 'c' (change) which combines those operations.
  5c
  input text
  here.
  .
will delete line 5 and replace it by the lines

input text
here.

Note that the text following 'c', just like the text after 'i' and
'a', must end with a line containing just one '.' and nothing else.
This directory contains a file named 'short'
with six lines in it.  Change the last line to read

new version of last line

and rewrite the file; then end with "ready".
