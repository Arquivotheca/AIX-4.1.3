By now you are probably wondering how you
get into the editor if someone else doesn't put
you there.  The main command interpreter (the shell)
recognizes
  ex
as the name of the editor.
You can give a file name,
which becomes the current file.  Thus
  ex NAME
in response to '%' puts you in the editor with
current file as specified by NAME.
So you can print a file with the sequence
  ex file
  1,$p
  w
  q
All right.  There is a file in the current
directory named for a New Jersey city.  Print
it with "cat" and then with the editor.
Then type "ready".
