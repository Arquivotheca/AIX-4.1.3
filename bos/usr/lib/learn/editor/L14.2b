You can use all kinds of addresses with "=" so
that you can find the number of the last line with
   $=
for example.  There is a file 'monteverdi' in this
directory: find out the number of the next to last line.
Then exit from the editor with wq and type "answer N"
where N is the number of the next to last line.
