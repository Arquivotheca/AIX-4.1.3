#print
This is an easy unit.  If you just hit
"newline" (or "carriage return", whatever it
is labeled on your terminal), the
editor will simply print the next line
as you can see by trying this out.  Edit the
file "pres"; print some line; then hit return
or newline, and watch the editor print the
next line.  Is there any difference between
newline and ".+1p" as a command?  When you
think you know, leave the editor and type "yes" or "no".
