#print
To move around, you can use simple arithmetic
when specifying what to print.  For example,
  3+1p
is the same as
  4p
as an editor command.  Now that's not very interesting;
but if the '.' current line pointer is line 3,
then using
  .+1p
instead of 4p is helpful.
For example, print the 3rd and 4th
lines of the familiar file using first "3p" to
get to line 3 and then ".+1p" to print the next line.
End as usual with w, q, and ready.
