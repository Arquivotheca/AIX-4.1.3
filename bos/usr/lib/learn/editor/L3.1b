A particularly important editor command
is 'w' (write).  This writes whatever
you are working on, including everything you
have typed in or changed, into a file,
so that you can work on it again later.
If you try to quit from the editor without
writing out your changes, the editor will complain.
Generally it's wisest to leave the editor by typing

w
q

rather than just 'q'.  I'll put you in the editor;
type those two commands to leave.  Then type
"ready".

#pipe

#unpipe
#cmp pres bpres
#succeed
Note that the editor typed
	"pres" 1 line, 27 characters
This is the number of characters and lines it wrote into the file.
This is reassuring - it tells you the write was successful.
It also lets you compare these numbers with those it typed
just before it gave you a ':'.
