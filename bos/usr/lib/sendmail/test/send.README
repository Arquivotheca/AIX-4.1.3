   BASIC STEPS USED TO RUN TEST ------------------------------------


        1. Set up machines with the appropriate configurations.
           Refer to the SendMail LPP/FVT Test Plan.

        2. Copy the above files onto the LOCAL HOST in an appropriate
           subdirectory (e.g., /tmp or create your own; rwx by ALL).

        3. "cd" to the subdirectory in step 2.

        4. Edit testenv file as appropriate. 
	   ($USER and $USER2 and their addresses should be set)

        5. Make testlist from testlist.c

        6. Run runtest ( as user ) to start test scripts.

            o--Run runtest ( as root ) to start test scripts for SendMail.
               Syntax:  runtest send[:num[-num|,num]...]
               Example: runtest send                 # for ALL test cases
                        runtest send:1-5,20,30-32    # specific tests

        7. Review output in ./log subdirectory.


    ASSUMPTIONS ------------------------------------------------------


        - The /etc/hosts file exists w/appropriate hosts
        - Interfaces are configured and are up.


SENDMAIL testcases:
-------------------
In order to run the sendmail scripts the following conditions should
be met:
		- These must be run by a Super User: root
		- /etc/sendmail.pid must indicate the pid of the current
		  sendmail daemon process.
		- All lockfiles, semaphores and permissions should be clear on
		  the queueing directories and on $HOME directories.
