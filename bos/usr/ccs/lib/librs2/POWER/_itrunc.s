#       Double to Integer Conversion -- Truncate (Round toward zero)
#
#       itrunc is the function performed when a FORTRAN or C double
#       is converted to a signed integer.
#
#       Converts a double precision value in fr0 to a signed
#       integer in r3 as if the rounding mode were round toward zero.
#
#       itrunc expects its argument to be an FPR not a GPR; Therefore
#       a C prototype should be used so that the argument is only
#       passed in the FPR's.
#
#       Note that this routine needs a little bit of storage
#       to move a value from an FPR to a GRP.  Rather than buying
#       a stack frame, it assumes that the storage at a small
#       negative offset from the caller's stack pointer (r1) is
#       available.  This is exactly what the compiler does for
#       short leaf routines.
#
#       Uses Rios-II convert to integer instruction, and assumes
#       that the instruction correctly sets all required IEEE
#       status flags.
#
# RETURNS: 
#	A signed integer
