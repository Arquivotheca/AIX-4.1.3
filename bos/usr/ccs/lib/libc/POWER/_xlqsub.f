        double complex function _xlqsub(%val(X),%val(x),%val(Y),%val(y))
        implicit real*8 (A-H,O-Z)
        logical i, j
C       Computes (Z,z) = (X,x) - (Y,y), where
C       the notation (p,q) denotes a quad precision number, in which
C       p is the high order word (as an IEEE double precision word),
C       and q is the low order word (as an IEEE double precision word.)
C       The fundamental operation is to combine two double precision words
C       to form a quad precision word.  The underlying operation to compute
C         (A,a) = x + y is as follows (in C-style coding):
C            A = x + y;
C            a = (abs(x) > abs(y)? x - A + y : y - A + x;
C         To carry out (Z,z) = (X,x) + (Y,y) do the following:
C            (S,s) = X + Y  (as in the above description)
C            (T,t) = x + y  (as in the above description)
C            (H,h) = S + (s + T)  (as in the above description)
C            (Z,z) = H + (t + h)  (as in the above description)
C         It is believed that the last two operations can be performed
C         more simply with only conventional double precision arithmetic
C         (i.e. not testins which of S and s+T is the larger).
C         In the code that follows below, in order to recover some of the
C         time due to branching, computations are performed speculatively.
C         For example sx represents the value of s in the event that X > Y,
C         and sy represents the value of s otherwise.  Likewise tx represents
C         t when x > y, and ty represents t otherwise.
