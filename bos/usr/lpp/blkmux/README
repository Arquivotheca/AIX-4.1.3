****************************************************************************
The following is a description of a test application shipped with the blkmux 
product.
****************************************************************************

370 based test programs CSX and STEP are used to verify the connection
between the workstation and the 370.
For these programs to verify the connection, the Block Multiplexer
Channel Adapter must be on-line.
The adapter is only on-line when it is opened by an application.
Placing the adapter on-line with SMIT is only giving permission
to go on-line when an application does an OPEN.

For testing convenience, an application to put the card on-line
is provided.  The application is named catcsx , and is located
in the directory named /usr/lpp/blkmux/test.

To put the card on-line for testing by CSX or STEP,
use the following procedure.

1)  Log on to the system.
    Ask the workstation system administrator for help.

2)  type "cd /usr/lpp/blkmux/test"

3)  type "catcsx"

4)  select option 0 - Open device.

5)  select option 0 - Open cat0.

6)  select option 1 - Start subchannel.

7)  select option 0 - Non-claw mode.

8)  type "01" or other 8 bit channel address in hex.
    This address must be one of the allowed addresses already
    set up using SMIT.

9)  select option 1 - unsolicited device end.

At this point the system should respond with a message like
  "device /dev/cat0 has subchannel 01 online.

You may now run CSX or STEP from the 370.

After you have finished running CSX or STEP,
select option 5 - Quit.
This will close that channel address, and make it available
for other applications.
