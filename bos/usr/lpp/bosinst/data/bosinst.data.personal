# NOTE:  After this first comment section ends, COMMENTS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED.
#
# NOTE: Stanzas follow these rules:
#       1. Stanza names must be at the beginning of the line and end in a colon.
#       2. Comments may be after the colon, but THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE!!!! other
#          than here in the header.  Even then, don't expect those comments
#          to be put back where they were after BOS install gets done processing
#          this file.  We reserve the right to mangle and ignore all comments
#          which are not placed in this header.
#       3. Stanza fields are on lines following stanza names,  Stanza fields
#          must NOT begin at the beginning of the line, but must have tabs or
#          blanks in front of them.
#       4. There can be no blank lines between field lines of the same stanza.
#       5. A blank line MUST separate each stanza.  In other words, after the
#          last field line of the stanza, a blank line must follow before the
#          line containing the stanza name of the next stanza.
#
# NOTE: In this comment section, the values listed in the fields are the
#       possible ones separated by a comma.  You must pick only one if you are
#       creating stanzas after the comment section.  Field options listed in
#       angle brackets (<...>) are descriptions of the field and not actually
#       the values which would go in the field.
#
# # control_flow defines the flow of control during BOS install.
# control_flow:
#     INSTALL_TYPE = full, client, personal
#     CONSOLE = < Device which will be your console.  Passed to chcons. >
#     INSTALL_METHOD = overwrite, preserve, migrate
#     PROMPT = yes,no
#     EXISTING_SYSTEM_OVERWRITE = yes,no
#     INSTALL_X_IF_ADAPTER = yes,no
#     RUN_STARTUP = yes,no
#     RM_INST_ROOTS = yes,no
#     ERROR_EXIT = < Command to run when error occurs.  Must be in boot image. >
#     CUSTOMIZATION_FILE = < Command to run after BOS install finishes. >
#     TCB = yes, no  <turns on/off trusted computing base>
#     BUNDLES = < Bundle file to install after auto install.  >
# 
# There can be multiple target_disk_data stanzas.  They define which disk(s)
# will contain the root volume group.  Only one field (LOCATION, SIZE_MB,
# HDISKNAME) must be non-null for BOS install to choose a disk.  The order of
# precedence is LOCATION, then SIZE_MB, then HDISKNAME.  If LOCATION is set,
# BOS install will ignore SIZE_MB and HDISKNAME.  If LOCATION is not set and
# SIZE_MB is, BOS install will select disks based on SIZE_MB and ignore
# HDISKNAME.  If LOCATION and SIZE_MB are both empty, BOS install will choose
# the disk specified in HDISKNAME.  If all three are empty, BOS install will
# choose for you.
# WARNING:  Don't leave the target_disk_data stanza(s) empty if PROMPT = no
#           unless you don't care which disk BOS install overwrites, because
#           the algorithm for determining the default disk on which to install
#           is not always predictable.
# The SIZE_MB field can contain either a size or the word 'largest'.  If a size
# is listed, BOS install will do a best-fit on the disks.  If the word 'largest'
# is in that field, BOS install will pick the largest disk.  If there are more
# than one target_disk_data stanza, BOS install will pick the two 'largest'
# disks, etc.

#     CULTURAL_CONVENTION = <primary cc to use after reboot>
