*-----------------------------------------------------
*
* The "Liberty" virus.     Normally infects EXE and COM files that
*   are executed, but in some circumstances (particularly when a disk
*   is very full) will also infect floppy disk boot sectors.  Also
*   on rarish occasions, will install a variety of interrupt handlers
*   which will cause some alteration of data sent to the screen,
*   the printer, and the asynch ports via BIOS.   A "damaged"
*   strain also exists in which this code is buggy, and will
*   hang the machine.
*
* Features: Infects COM, infects EXE, infects floppy, uses MZ, resident.
*
* Signature for the "damaged" strain. This will also be found in the
* undamaged strain.

*------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* The FISH 6 virus.   While it is active in memory, infected
*   files don't appear infected.   It also spreads aggressively,
*   sort of Dark-Avenger-like.  Much code taken from the 4096.
*   If the year is after 1990, will sometimes hang the machine
*   after printing a short message.
*
*  Features: Infects COM, Infects EXE, Uses MZ, Resident
*
8F06DB0E2E8326DB0EFE2E803EDA0E0075112EFF36DB0E
%s the Fish 6 virus.
COM and EXE files, scan memory, pause if found.
*------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* The V512 virus, from the Bulgarian collection.   Uses a
*   number of undocumented DOS calls and control blocks, and
*   therefore will tend to crash under various versions of DOS and odd setups.
*   No intentional damage or symptoms evident.   If the virus is
*   in memory, files will not appear infected, usually.  Infects
*   *.CO* files that are executed or closed while the virus is active.
*
*   Features: Infects COM, Resident
*
C575F648D0EC2264047421B820008ED82BD2E865FF8BF2
%s the V512 virus.
COM files only, scan memory, pause if found.
*-----------------------------------------------------
*
* The "Do-Nothing 2"; a trivial modification of the Do-Nothing.
* This one doesn't do anything significant, either.  A silly virus,
* that will crash any system with <640K, and doesn't work reliably
* even then.
*
*  Features: infects COM, resident.
*
C21ECD707219A36F00B442B0028B1E6F00B90000
%s the Do-Nothing 2 virus.
(COM files only)

*
*  Features: infects COM.
*
B90800BEDF03BF00F8FCF3A4B9E7028B364001
%s the Taiwan 2 virus.
(COM files only)

*
* The V1024 virus.  When the virus is in memory, files will appear
* with the uninfected lengths in DIR output.   If a color display in
* 25x80 text mode is active, the virus will on rather rare occasions
* cause a pattern of bouncing multicolored diamonds to appear, making
* the machine rather difficult to use...
*
*  Infects COM, infects EXE, uses MZ, resident
*
4A8EC233FFB943008B55022BD13BD0723CFA26294D03895502
%s the V1024 virus.
COM and EXE files.
*-----------------------------------------------------
*
* The SHAKE virus.   When the virus is in memory, files will appear
* with their uninfected lengths in DIR output.  Infects the first
* uninfected *.COM file in the current directory whenever a "Get
* Disk Free Space" call is made (for some reason).  After an infected
* file is executed, there is a one-in-16 (or so) chance that any
* program run afterwards will not in fact be run, but will instead
* produce the message "Shake well before use!".  (This message will,
* however, only occur once per boot.)
*
*       Features: Infects COM, Resident
*
DC01075B58CF80FC4B75225052B42CCD2180E20F08D2
%s the Shake virus.

%s the FLASH virus.
(COM and EXE files)
*-----------------------------------------------------
*
* The 1701-Jojo virus.   A non-garbled variant of the 1701; instead of
* the 1701's screen effects, the 1701-Jojo will display diamond-shaped
* patterns of multicolored blocks on a color display if an
* infected program is run when the virus is already in memory,
* and the time is 7pm or after.
*
* Features: infects COM, uses MZ, resident
*

COM files only.
*----------------------------------------------------------------------*
*
* The SLOW virus.  Infects EXE and COM files as they are executed.
* Much of the code is copied from the 1813.  Only "damage" is to
* set an occasional file's timestamp to zero when it is closed,
* on some Fridays after 12/31/1990.
*
* Features: Infects COM, infects EXE, uses MZ, resident.
*
DE909081C61B00B990062E8034
%s the SLOW virus.
COM and EXE files.
*-----------------------------------------------------
*
* The SVIR virus.  When an infected file is executed, it will look

*
* Features: Infects EXE
*
E788261900A11D00A32100A11B00A32300C7061B000000
%s the SVIR virus.

*-----------------------------------------------------
*
* The STAF virus.  Another awkward, buggy "demo" virus; infected files

* zero or more *.COM files in the current directory.
*
* Features: Infects COM
*
CFBACB01E80AFFBA8F02E820FFE801FFB80057CD215152B000
