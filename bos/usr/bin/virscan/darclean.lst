This file may be infected with the Dark Avenger virus.
(COM and EXE files. Pause if found. Scan memory.)
*
* Dark Avenger damage signature; once in every sixteen executions of
* an infected file (counter kept in sector 0), the virus will overwrite
* a more-or-less random sector on the disk with a block beginning
* with the string "Eddie lives...somewhere in time!", and containing
* some of the virus' own code, including that given here.
*  Since this string will also identify infected files, it is
* recommended that to avoid confusion one should first thoroughly
* remove all infected files (using the usual VIRSCAN Dark Avenger
* signature), before using this signature to find damaged files.
* This signature should also be used with the -a option, since
* it may well be in non-executable files.   As in:
*
*     VIRSCAN C: D: -SDARCLEAN.LST -A -P
