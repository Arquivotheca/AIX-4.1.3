/*  The Client/Server test protocol tests the network device driver by      */
/*  establishing a session between two adapters (either on two different    */
/*  machines or on the same machine).  The "Client" side of the session     */
/*  sends test frames to a "Server" that verifies the test data and         */
/*  responds with an ack for every N test frames received.  To prevent      */
/*  the Client side from receiving its own test frames, an address          */
/*  resolution handshake is performed before the tests are started -- the   */
/*  Client sends an ARP broadcast with its hardware address to the Server.  */
/*  The Server receives this packet and saves the hardware address (for use */
/*  in ack'ing the Client) before returning an ARP response back to the     */
/*  Client with the Server hardware address.                                */
/*     After the address resolution procedure is completed, the Client      */
/*  sends a test parameters packet that configures the Server side with the */
/*  parameters of the next battery of tests (these parameters are prompted  */
/*  for at the Client side).  The Server responds with an ack and waits for */
/*  test frames from the Client.  The Client sends N test frames to the     */
/*  Server and awaits an ack before continuing with the next N test         */
/*  frames.  Each side has a receive timeout in the event of failure at     */
/*  the other end of the session.  When all test frames have been sent,     */
/*  the Client sends a halt packet; the Server responds with a "test        */
/*  results" packet that contains error statistics logged on the Server     */
/*  side of the session.  The Client combines this information with its     */
/*  own statistics and displays them at the end of the tests.         */
/* Two types of errors are checked for; lost frames and corrupted     */
/*  test data frames.  Each frame has a sequence number that reveals lost   */
/*  frames (indicated by frames arriving without consecutive sequence       */
/*  numbers).  Each test data frame is validated byte-for-byte at the       */
/*  Server end when zero, ones, or incrementing data patterns are sent.     */
/* Both the Client and Server are equipped with error recovery logic   */
/*  in the event of dropped or corrupted frames; retries are performed at   */
/*  each end of the connection to avoid deadlock situations.  If the Client */
/*  times out awaiting an ack, it sends the next burst of test frames and   */
/*  listens again for a response before giving up.  If the Server times out */
/*  awaiting a test packet, it sends an ack and waits again for a test      */
/*  packet before giving up.                                                */
