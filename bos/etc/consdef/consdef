# The console definition file is used for defining async terminal devices
# which are the console candidates at system boot.  During system boot,
# all natively attached graphic displays, any async terminal on native serial
# port S1, and async terminals defined in this file will display the
# system console selection prompt.  Only one terminal may be selected as
# console.  If the terminal attributes are not specified in this file,
# default values from the odm database are assumed.  However, the location 
# and connection attributes are mandatory.  The location value may be
# displayed with the lsdev command.
# 
# The entries must be in the following format:
#
#ALTTTY:
# 	connection=value
#	location=nn-nn-ss-nn
#	attribute=value
#	.
#	.
#ALTTTY:
#	connection=value
#	location=nn-nn-ss-nn
#	attribute=value
#	.
# 	. 
#  Lines in this file must not exceed 80 characters. All comments must be
#  preceded by a pound sign (#) in the first column. 
#
#  For backward compatibility, the "ALTTTY:" keyword is not required 
#  for the first entry. 
#
#
#  For example, to enable the console selection message on the tty attached to 
#  the S2 port, uncomment the following stanza: 
#
#ALTTTY:
#	connection=rs232
#	location=00-00-S2-00
#	speed=9600
#	bpc=8
#	stops=1
#	flow_disp=xon
#	parity=none
#	term=ibm3151
