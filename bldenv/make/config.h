 * RECHECK
 *	If defined, Make_Update will check a target for its current
 *	modification time after it has been re-made, setting it to the
 *	starting time of the make only if the target still doesn't exist.
 *	Unfortunately, under NFS the modification time often doesn't
 *	get updated in time, so a target will appear to not have been
 *	re-made, causing later targets to appear up-to-date. On systems
 *	that don't have this problem, you should defined this. Under
 *	NFS you probably should not, unless you aren't exporting jobs.
