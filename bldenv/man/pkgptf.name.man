        Contains apar with comment that should be used when the PTF
        image is created.  Lines beginning with the key word
        ADDITIONAL_COMMENT allow comments to span multiple lines.
        Lines beginning with a "#" are ignored.  The comment field
        overrides the comment field taken from the lpp_name file
        for the PTF.
