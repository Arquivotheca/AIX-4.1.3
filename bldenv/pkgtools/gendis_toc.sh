#
#   Purpose:
#       Called from gendikette to create toc from lpp_name files
#
#   Syntax:
#       gendis_toc imagedir stacklist TOC work stck tocfdir
#
#   Flags:  Ref. usage message
#
#   Change history:
#       03/13/92-kml-changed to use toc files contained in $6 directory
#                    insted of extracting them from bff files. 
#       05/14/91 created from v3.1 utility
#	6/10/91 Modified to use ./$$ as work area, not /tmp--Defect 20434
#	6/10/91 Modified to make $fsize always numeric     --Defect 21259
#	6/28/91 Modified to detect blank lines in stack list
#	7/02/91 Removed redundant error checking
#	7/31/91 Modified to use work directory for lpp_name files
#	7/31/91 Added quiet_abort to handle while read loop exiting
#	7/31/91 Added $cmd to ERROR messages
#
#========================================================================

# Function: abort is called when an un-recoverable error has been detected
abort() {
  exit 1
}

# Function: quiet_abort is called when a 'while read' loop aborts
quiet_abort() {
  exit 1
