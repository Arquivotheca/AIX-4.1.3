/*  ffilecopy  --  very fast buffered file copy

 *  Usage:  i = ffilecopy (here,there)
 *	int i;
 *	FILE *here, *there;
 *
 *  Ffilecopy is a very fast routine to copy the rest of a buffered
 *  input file to a buffered output file.  Here and there are open
 *  buffers for reading and writing (respectively); ffilecopy
 *  performs a file-copy faster than you should expect to do it
 *  yourself.  Ffilecopy returns 0 if everything was OK; EOF if
 *  there was any error.  Normally, the input file will be left in
 *  EOF state (feof(here) will return TRUE), and the output file will be
 *  flushed (i.e. all data on the file rather in the core buffer).
 *  It is not necessary to flush the output file before ffilecopy.
