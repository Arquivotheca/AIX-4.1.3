Any time changes are made that affect the toc processing code a 3.2
inutoc executable must be created for BAI.  In order to do this one 
must cd to src/bldenv/inutoc and copy Makefile.org to Makefile.  Once
this is done execute 'build' as normally done.  Upon successful comple-
tion of the build copy ../../../../obj/power/bldenv/inutoc/inutoc to
the current directory so that it can be dropped from here.
